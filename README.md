# Rainfall Prediction using Machine Learning Algorithms

Rainfall prediction is a critical task for **weather forecasting** and **agricultural planning**. This project leverages machine learning algorithms to predict the amount of rainfall based on historical weather data.

The main objective is to identify the relevant atmospheric features that cause rainfall and predict the intensity of daily rainfall using various machine learning algorithms such as **Multivariate Linear Regression (MLR), Multilayer Perceptron Regressor (Neural Network), KNN Regressor, Ridge Regression, Random Forest Regressor**, and **Support Vector Regression (SVR)**.

The **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** and **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** metrics were used to measure the performance of the machine learning models.
